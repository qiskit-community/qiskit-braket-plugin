# Quickstart Guide

The quickstart guide is similar to the beginner's guide. The key difference is that the quickstart guide assumes the user already understands what the software intends to do and generally how they would like to use it, and they just need to quickly get spun up on the API. To that end, this document won't provide any scientific background or detailed tutorials/how-tos. It will focus more on installation and usage.

## Installation

Refer to [installation guide](./installation_guide.md).

## Usage

Refer to [how-to-guidelines](./how_tos) or [tutorials](./tutorials).
